    Introduction to Exceptions in Python

    Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions. 
    They can be caused by various issues, such as invalid input, file not found, or division by zero.

    Common Runtime Errors:
    - ZeroDivisionError: Raised when dividing by zero.
    - FileNotFoundError: Raised when trying to access a file that does not exist.
    - ValueError: Raised when a function receives an argument of the right type but inappropriate value.

    Handling Exceptions:
    Python provides a way to handle exceptions using try-except blocks. 
    This allows the program to continue running even if an error occurs.

    Example:
    try:
        # Code that may raise an exception
        result = 10 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    """

    pass  # This function is intentionally left blank for demonstration purposes.
