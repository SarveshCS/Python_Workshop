# Exception Handling in Python

This directory contains examples and explanations related to exception handling in Python. Understanding exceptions is crucial for writing robust and error-resistant code. Below are the key components covered in this directory:

## Introduction to Exceptions

- **What are Exceptions?**  
  Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions. They can be caused by various issues, such as invalid input, file not found, or division by zero.

- **Common Runtime Errors:**  
  Some common runtime errors include:
  - `FileNotFoundError`: Raised when trying to access a file that does not exist.
  - `ValueError`: Raised when a function receives an argument of the right type but inappropriate value.

## Try-Except Blocks

- **Basic Structure:**  
  The `try` block lets you test a block of code for errors. The `except` block lets you handle the error.

  ```python
  try:
      # Code that may raise an exception
  except SomeException:
      # Code to handle the exception
  ```

- **Example Scenarios:**  
  The `try_except.py` file contains practical examples demonstrating how to handle various exceptions effectively.

## Raise and Assert Statements

- **Raise Statement:**  
  The `raise` statement is used to trigger an exception manually. This is useful for enforcing certain conditions in your code.

  ```python
  if condition_not_met:
      raise ValueError("A descriptive error message")
  ```

- **Assert Statement:**  
  The `assert` statement is used to test if a condition is true. If the condition is false, it raises an `AssertionError`.

  ```python
  assert condition, "Error message if condition is false"
  ```

- **Custom Exceptions:**  
  The `raise_assert.py` file includes examples of creating and using custom exceptions to handle specific error cases in your application.

## Edge Cases and Variations

- Handling exceptions gracefully is essential. Consider edge cases such as:
  - Attempting to open a file that the user does not have permission to access.
  - Providing invalid input types to functions.

By understanding and implementing these concepts, you can create more reliable and maintainable Python applications. For practical exercises that integrate file operations with exception handling, refer to the `exercises` directory.
