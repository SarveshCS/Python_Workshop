# Exercises on Files and Exceptions

This folder contains practical exercises that integrate file operations with exception handling in Python. The exercises are designed to help you understand how to work with files while managing potential errors effectively.

## Exercises Overview

1. **Reading from a File**: 
   - Write a program that reads data from a specified file. Handle exceptions such as `FileNotFoundError` and `IOError` to ensure the program does not crash if the file is missing or unreadable.

2. **Writing to a File**: 
   - Create a program that writes user input to a file. Implement exception handling to manage scenarios where the file cannot be opened for writing, such as permission errors.

3. **Appending to a File**: 
   - Develop a script that appends data to an existing file. Include error handling for cases where the file might not exist or is not writable.

4. **File Format Validation**: 
   - Write a program that reads a file and validates its format (e.g., checking for CSV structure). Use assertions to ensure the data meets expected criteria, raising exceptions for invalid formats.

5. **Combining File Operations**: 
   - Create a comprehensive exercise that combines reading, writing, and appending to files. Handle all potential exceptions that may arise during these operations.

## Tips for Handling Exceptions

- Always use `try-except` blocks to catch exceptions that may occur during file operations.
- Be specific with the exceptions you catch to avoid masking other potential issues.
- Use `finally` blocks if you need to execute cleanup code, such as closing files.
- Consider using `with` statements for file operations to ensure files are properly closed even if an error occurs.

By completing these exercises, you will gain hands-on experience with file operations and exception handling in Python, preparing you for real-world programming challenges.
